Our first value of interest was to evaluate the highest proportion of people with access to hand washing in any of the countries as of the most recent date. The highest proportion identified is `r summary_list$maximum_proportion_handwash`. Only `r summary_list$max_prop_how_many` country( or countries) share the highest proportion. Subsequently, the lowest proportion identified is `r summary_list$minimum_proportion_handwash`, with `r summary_list$min_prop_how_many` country (countries) sharing this proportion. The average percentage of poverty throughout the world throughout the years is `r summary_list$avg_prop_poverty`. Finally, the median cholera cases of all the countries as of the most recent year is `r summary_list$median_cholera_cases`, while the average cholera cases of all the countries as of the most recent year is `r summary_list$avg_cholera_cases``.

## Table
```{r, echo = FALSE}
highest_poverty <- poverty %>%
  group_by(country)%>%
  filter(percPoverty >= 50.0)
table <- as.data.table(highest_poverty)
kable(table)
 
```

I chose this table because it represents the countries that have a majority poverty population. I included this table because we can use the information off this table to determine the link between poverty and disease. The information presented on this table include the name of the country, the percentage of poverty in each country, the year the data was collected, and the percentage of population that learn less than 10 dollars a day, and less than 5.50 dollars a day specifically. This table allows us to see the most impoverished countries in the world, which we can use to establish connections between widespread economic struggle, and increase of disease rates. It also reveals the scope of poverty and its definitions that are used by organizations. There is a trend that the countries with the highest rates of poverty are centered around Africa and the Middle East, and that the vast majority of the populations depicted in the table earn less than 10 USD each day.

```
The reason for working on this chart is to delve into how poverty can affect access to clean water services. This problem that stems from poverty can result in diseases such as cholera, or symptoms of diarrhea, and other factors. This may also result in health problems, and thus more money spent on those services, continuing and increasing the cycle of poverty. From the graph and data that I analyzed, the companies with the lowest poverty rates ended up having the most access to handwashing. The divide between the average of the lowest poverty rate countries and highest poverty rates was 86.17% compared to 25.21% which is a really big gap. Thus, there needs to be a lot more emphasis on countries that have high poverty rates. The data was not surprising in terms of the condition of the countries and their percentages, but the gap between each condition was alarming to see, especially at the extreme ends of each side.
