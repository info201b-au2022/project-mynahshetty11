## Introduction

Access to clean water and sanitation is a privilege that most first world countries have. However, not all countries in the world are able to provide sanitation services to some or all of their citizens. Additionally, not all people in the world are able to afford clean water and sanitation. As a result, the people who can't afford these services have resort to less hygienic means, including using unclean water, handwashing without soap, open defecation, and more. Clean water and sanitation services are important because they help promote good hygiene, and prevent germs and diseases from spreading. Unclean water and sanitation services may not only be ineffective against preventing diseases and infections; they may also cause them, as many people die from diarrhea and cholera caused by drinking unclean water. With this in mind, we have decided to research the issue of inequitable access to sanitation services.

## Questions

For our project, we decided to ask the following questions:

### 1. What is the relationship between proportion of people without access to clean water, sanitation services and the proportion of people who get infected with cholera?

This question researches how strong the correlation between proportion of access to safely managed sanitation services and cholera infection rates.

### 2. What is the relationship between proportion of people without access to clean water, sanitation services and the proportion of children who die from diarrheal diseases?

We ask this question to research if there is a relation (or correlation) between the proportion of people who are unable to use clean sanitation services in each country and the proportion of children who died from diarrhea related illnesses from their respective country.

### 3. How does poverty affect the proportion of people's ability to afford clean and safely managed sanitation services?

We ask this question to assess the strength of the relationship between poverty and hygiene. This helps with addressing the question of what we must do to help increase equitable access to sanitation services, as addressing the issue of poverty may intersect with assisting people's ability to afford hygienic services.

<<<<<<<<<<< EDIT THIS STUFF HERE! The person in charge of writing the dataset should move these URLs to each related dataset. We might not need all of them. ALso feel free to add questions in the questions section. 3 is technically good enough cuz the four person example had 3 questions, but ymmv>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
