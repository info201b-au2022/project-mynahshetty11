## Introduction

Access to clean water and sanitation is a privilege that most first world countries have. However, not all countries in the world are able to provide sanitation services to some or all of their citizens. Additionally, not all people in the world are able to afford clean water and sanitation. As a result, the people who can't afford these services have resort to less hygienic means, including using unclean water, hand washing without soap, open defecation, and more. Clean water and sanitation services are important because they help promote good hygiene, and prevent germs and diseases from spreading. Unclean water and sanitation services may not only be ineffective against preventing diseases and infections; they may also cause them, as many people die from diarrhea and cholera caused by drinking unclean water. With this in mind, we have decided to research the issue of inequitable access to sanitation services.

## Questions

For our project, we decided to ask the following questions:

### 1. What is the relationship between proportion of people without access to clean water, sanitation services and the proportion of people who get infected with cholera?

This question researches how strong the correlation between proportion of access to safely managed sanitation services and cholera infection rates.

### 2. What is the relationship between proportion of people without access to clean water, sanitation services and the proportion of children who die from diarrheal diseases?

We ask this question to research if there is a relation (or correlation) between the proportion of people who are unable to use clean sanitation services in each country and the proportion of children who died from diarrhea related illnesses from their respective country.

### 3. How does poverty affect the proportion of people's ability to afford clean and safely managed sanitation services?

We ask this question to assess the strength of the relationship between poverty and hygiene. This helps with addressing the question of what we must do to help increase equitable access to sanitation services, as addressing the issue of poverty may intersect with assisting people's ability to afford hygienic services.


## The Dataset

Our dataset is related to our project domain because it illustrates the number of cases of disease to a country, how many people fall under the poverty line, open defection rates, and handwashing rates. This can help us answer our questions on how poverty, access to clean water and sanitation methods, and diagnosis of cholera/ diarrheal disease are related.

## Expected Implications

Assuming that areas that are poverty stricken have less access to clean water, the people in the affected areas have a higher likelihood of being infected with diseases such as cholera or diarrheal disease.
**For technologists/ experts in the health and sanitation fields**, the focus would need to shift more on how to provide poverty-stricken areas with simple necessities such as access to clean water and sanitation services. Technologists would need to put out products that are affordable and can allow these areas to boil their own water so that they won’t contract such diseases.
**For designers**, implications would likely be designing affordable products and educational services for these areas to learn how. Designers would need to craft methods that would help “fix” the structural barriers these communities have to safe sanitization methods.
**For policy makers**, they need to write policy that makes sanitation methods readily available. Clean water and sanitary cleaning methods are not privileges; everyone should have the right to access these methods. Policy needs to be written whether that’s by increasing funding for materials to educate and give access to clean water and sanitation services, or by providing more job opportunities so people can afford to live healthily and without risk of contracting diseases due to the lack of sanitation.

## Problem Domain

Use short sub-sections to describe your topic and the setting (that is, the sociotechnical situation), including project framing, human values, direct and indirect stakeholders, possible harms and benefits. See the Design Brief, section B.3. Note: You must include three citations to related work (URLs to similar work, high quality articles from the popular press, research papers, etc. ). You may find it helpful to include a figure. (About 400 words.)

The sub-sections can be split into:

- Sanitation services
- Drinking water services
- Handwashing with soap
- Open defecation

The data examines the many sources of water used for hygiene, and how the quality of water affects the spread of disease. Water is a vital part in health, and is something that needs to be addressed in communities. In our project, we look to explore countries that are struggling with water services, and focusing on pointing out patterns throughout those countries. We plan to visualize a series of graphs, as well as citing evidence from the statistics that we find.

The human values that this addresses is:

- community
- power
- justice
- service
- health

Harm: Through tackling the problems that are associated with water quality, there would be a lot less diseases being spread, and thus deaths. One harm with water quality is that a lot of the conditions stem from poverty. Because of this, solutions can be hard to come up with as a lot comes from completely changing the infrastructure.

Benefit: A lot of death and sickness can be avoided with better water quality amongst all countries. Overall, a benefit involves ethics, ensuring that clean water is a basic human right. It is the right thing to do to advocate.

Stakeholders:

Direct: The people directly affected would be the ones that are using the water systems. This could be families, people, or other inhabitants.

Indirect: The government, who are affected by the opinion of their citizens. The workers that provide the facilities as they are the ones monitoring it.

## Limitations

A major limitation for this project is the possible existence of confounding factors. For example, natural disasters, civil unrest, or political instability could lead to lack of medicine and food, and therefore contribute to high infant/child mortality. Furthermore, the Cholera virus might be indigenous or dominant in certain areas of the world, which would influence the amount of cholera cases independently from the sanitation level. For example, a area with good sanitation might have a higher incidence of Cholera virus than somewhere else simply because the Cholera virus is more dominant in that area. Another limitation for this project is how it only focuses on two diseases, while unclean water and poverty could possibly be linked to many more. While it would be helpful to establish two connections, establishing a systemic connection between poverty, unclean water, and disease could have much larger implications. Also, having just two connections makes it more likely that this trend is simply an outlier, and could hide the truth about these alleged connections.

This illustrates that even though the US is a 1st world country, water still goes untreated because of poverty and mismanagement. This situation is much worse in countries that are lacking in economy and power.
